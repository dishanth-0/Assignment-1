Q3.
'/'-It is the division operator. It is used to divide the one number by another.
    eg: a=10
        b=3
        c=a/b
        print(c)
        
'//'-It is the floor division operator which is used to get the quotient of the division of two numbers
     eg: a=15
         b=4
         c=a//b
         print(c)
   
'%'-It is the modulus operator which is used to get the remainder of the division of two numbers
     eg: a=19
         b=4
         c=a%b
         print(c)
         
'**'-It is the exponential operator which is used to raise the number to power of another
     eg: a=2
         b=4
         c=a**b
         print(c)
         
Q4.
l=[1,2,3,4,3.4,"dishanth","hegde",5,7,9]
for i in l:
    print(i)
    
    
Q5.
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
count=0
while a%b==0:
    a=a/b
    count += 1
    
if a==1:
    print(count," times divisible")
else:
    print("purely not divisible")
    
    
Q6.
l=[3,5,2,4,56,6,8,9,10,15,74,56,23,19,10,1,12,15,18,32,33,45,46,43,90]
for i in l:
    if i%3 == 0:
        print(i," is divisible by 3")
    else:
        print(i," is not divisible by 3")
        

Q7.
Immutable data types:    
Immutable data types are those whose values cannot be changed once they are created. 
Examples of immutable data types in Python include:
1.Numbers: integers, floats, and complex numbers
2.Strings: a sequence of characters
3.Tuples: an ordered sequence of elements
Eg:
my_str = "hello"
my_str[0] = "j"
Above code throws a Type error.

Mutable data types:
Mutable data types are those whose values can be changed after they are created.
Examples of mutable data types in Python include:
1.Lists: an ordered collection of elements
2.Dictionaries: an unordered collection of key-value pairs
3.Sets: an unordered collection of unique elements.
Eg:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list[1] = 6
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 6, 3, 4, 5]
